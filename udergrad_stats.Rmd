Below is the link to the repo containing lecture notes for the undergrad-level "Biostatics" course I gave in 2022 to medical students. The course aimed to provide a basic understanding of biostatistics, specifically focusing on basic statistical tests and how to correctly interpret hypothesis testing results, with a gentle introduction to regression models.
