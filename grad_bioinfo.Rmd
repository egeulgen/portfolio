Below is the link to the repo containing lecture notes for the PhD-level "Special Topics in Biostatistics and Bioinformatics" course that I instructed in 2022. Although there wasn't any pre-requisites, this course aimed to build on previous courses in the bioinformatics PhD curriculum to deliver common practical applications of bioinformatics approaches.
