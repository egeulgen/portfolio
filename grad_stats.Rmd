Below is the link to the repo containing lecture notes for the PhD-level "Probability & Statististics" course I gave in 2022. The course aimed to provide an extensive basis of probability and statistics, focusing on aspects related to biostatistics. I attempted to cover descriptive statistics, basics of probability, conditional probability, discrete and continuous distributions (outlining distributions commonly used in biostatistics), hypothesis testing, linear and generalized linear regression models, and resampling methods.
